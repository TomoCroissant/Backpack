## The Final Frontier

### Important notice: Midway through development, our IDE, Replit, lost its ability to run pygame. We are actively converting all of the source code to run in Processing.py instead. For this reason, there is no working exportable version of the project nor is there a picture of the runnning project.

# Update History

* Basic skeleton created by making classes and functions from class diagram.
* Player was drawn to screen with WASD controls.
* Inventory and Item classes removed.
* Basic save logic was created by writing to a .txt file and then retrieving data from that file when designated key pressed.
* Basic room logic created to record and display the current room (background).
* Bullet class created.
* Bullet logic created using vectors.
* Bullet drawn and animated to screen whenever the mouse was clicked.
* Room class removed.
* Bullet converted to a boomerang by inverting vectors once bullet reached desired position.
* Bullet limited by waiting until the boomerang returned to the player before shooting again.
* Sprites of characters, objects, and maps drawn to screen.
* Project broke because Replit no longer runs pygame on our devices.
